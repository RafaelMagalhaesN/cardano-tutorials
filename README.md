# The cardano tutorials.

This repository contains tutorials and guides on how to use the APIs and SDKs 
created by IOG to allow easy integration with the cardano blockchain.

I started this work due to the lack of readily available and easy to follow
instructions to guide new developers. My purpose is to make the learning curve
from using these tools less steep.

All instructions are based on what I found out from what I could gather from
the official documentation, trial and error, and by annoying the hell of most 
developers from IOG on telegram. If you find any incorrect assumption or 
instruction, please submit a pull request with amendments/clarification.

Feel free to submit pull requests with your guides and tutorials too.
